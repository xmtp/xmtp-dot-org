# Consent with XMTP

<p className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Solve spam and unwanted messages with user-controlled, privacy-first consent.</p>

XMTP's consent system gives your users complete inbox control with encrypted preferences that work across all apps built with XMTP, creating spam-free messaging experiences.

<br/>

:::info Key Takeaways

- **Spam-free messaging**: Users control who can reach them with private allow/block lists
- **Network-level consent**: Consent choices are stored at the network level and work across all apps built with XMTP
- **Privacy-first design**: Only users see their own messaging preferences—blocked contacts aren't notified
- **Future-ready protection from spam and AI threats**: Dual-layer defense with public contact rules and private consent *coming soon*

### Inboxes are for trusted contacts only

XMTP puts your user in complete control of their inbox. Each user maintains a private, encrypted list of the contacts they’ve accepted and blocked, keeping their inbox spam-free.

When a new contact tries to message your user, you can provide UIs for unconsented message requests—outside of their inbox.

</div>

Your user can then decide to accept or block the contact.

</div>

<br/>

 You can then display conversations with accepted contacts in their inbox.

### Network-level consent for seamless cross-app experiences

Consent preferences are stored on the XMTP network, not in individual apps. When your user accepts or blocks a contact, their consent preferences can be synced across all apps built with XMTP. This eliminates the user frustration of managing the same contacts across multiple messaging platforms. No need to accept or block the same contact in every app.

### Privacy-first spam prevention

Your users' messaging preferences stay completely private. Only they can see who they've allowed or blocked. Blocked users are unaware they're blocked. This provides a spam filter that respects user privacy while keeping unwanted messages out of the main inbox.

### Built for developers

XMTP's consent system automatically handles spam prevention and the complexity of cross-app consent preferences and privacy. This frees you up to focus on building great messaging experiences without worrying about having to build your own spam prevention tools.
