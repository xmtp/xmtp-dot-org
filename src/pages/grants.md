# XMTP Grants: Inspiring public goods

<br/>

:::caution XMTP Grants

XMTP is not accepting applications for grants at this time. Make sure to [follow XMTP on 𝕏](https://x.com/xmtp_) for updates on when grants will reopen.

:::

## ✨ Mission

Support projects, ideas, and people building on XMTP to foster ecosystem growth through public good creation.

## 📜 Request for proposals

We are open to any and all ideas! Below are just a few categories of projects we are particularly excited about.

### 🎨 Custom content types

- Media: Attachments, Voicenotes, Images
- Threading: Emoji reactions, Reply threads
- Transactions and payments

### 💾 Novel applications

- Rabbithole Quest
- Gitcoin messaging
- Pay to message

### 🎒 Allow/block backpack

- Follow
- Block/spam

### 🧠 Protocol development

- Multi-chain support (e.g. Solana, Bitcoin, Tezos, etc)
- Account abstraction

### 👨🏼‍💻 Developer tools

- Plug and play notification server
- Web3 resolver library

### 👀 Unique features

- Read receipts - opt-in, performant, interoperable
- Personalizable conversation sorting and filtering

:::note

All projects must propose a standard, tool, or concept that’s adopted by the ecosystem. This involves collaborating with the community to create a public good. You can leverage [XIPs](https://github.com/xmtp/XIPs/blob/main/XIPs/xip-0-purpose-process.md) to discuss proposals.

## 🔍 Grant types

We offer two types of grants: Micro grants and Kickstarter grants.

**Micro grants (<$5k):**

- Smaller project scope, faster review process
- Examples:
  - Opt-in, interoperable, performant read receipts
  - Rabbithole quest

**Kickstarter grants (<$10K):**

- Bigger project scope, fast review process
- Examples:
  - Cross-chain support or account abstraction
  - Universal allow/block backpack

📣 If you are unsure, message us via XMTP at `grants.xmtp.eth` and we'll be happy to help you figure out the grant type that's right for you.

## 🎯 Evaluation criteria

We love and encourage diversity of ideas in grant applications. This section lists the baseline expectations we have for all applications.

Example applications:

- Qualifies: a project that will introduce a novel feature (e.g. emoji reactions, read receipts, account abstraction, etc) and propose an XIP for a standard way to do it across different applications.
- Does not qualify: a project to integrate with XMTP to create a cool messaging app that doesn't create community resources (e.g. XIPs, dev tools, etc).

:::note

Building with XMTP is permissionless and grants are not a pre-requisite to integrate with XMTP. While we love and encourage a variety of integrations, grants are reserved for integrations that create public goods.

:::

XMTP Grants are **not** for:

- **Integrating with XMTP**: Merely integrating with XMTP does not qualify for a grant. Grant projects must create public goods for the ecosystem. Check out the Request for Proposal section for ideas.
- **Marketing budgets**: Grant money should not be used towards promoting or advertising projects.
- **Travel budgets**: Grants are not meant to fund plane tickets, accommodation costs, and other travel expenses.
- **Replacements for venture funding:** Grants are not substitutions for a round of funding. They are aimed at enabling discrete projects that create a public good for the ecosystem.
- **Free money**: Please don’t abuse this system. Our program’s mission is to support people who believe in the potential of web3 messaging and want to contribute to building in the space.
- **Stress relief**: Our grants are not intended to extend your runway or alleviate financial stress. You should aim to build long-term in our ecosystem.

Consider the following criteria if you’re uncertain whether your project qualifies for an XMTP grant:

- **Building in public**: Not all projects require code, but they should be built in the spirit of open-sourcing your learnings (and code if appropriate) for everyone to learn from.
- **Action > Perfection**: Show us how you or your team have the skills and potential to bring the proposal to life.
- **Definitive use case:** Articulate your idea clearly on how your project uses XMTP and adds value to the ecosystem. Please do not try to overthink or overcomplicate it.
- **Public Good creation**: Show clear connection between your proposal and the value it generates for the broader ecosystem.
- **Collaborate**: Be collaborative and open to offering support to other members of our community. Let’s grow together!
