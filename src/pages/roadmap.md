## Release cycles

Prior roadmaps combined multiple features into a single versioned release, such as XMTP v1 and v2.

Going forward, individual features will be released as they become available. For example, group chat, contact directory, key revocation, etc.

We typically follow this release cycle for new features:

- **Alpha**: Super early peek into the feature being built. Not ready for use in production apps.
- **Beta**: Opportunity to test, validate, and provide feedback. Not ready for use in production apps.
- **Production**: Ready for use in production apps.
