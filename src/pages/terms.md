# Terms of service

Our content licensing policies are based on those of the [Google Developer](https://developers.google.com/site-policies) website.

We are pleased to license much of the documentation on [xmtp.org](https://xmtp.org/) under terms that explicitly encourage people to take, modify, reuse, re-purpose, and remix this content as they see fit.

You will find the following notice at the bottom of pages on [xmtp.org](https://xmtp.org/):

> CC BY 4.0

This means that except as otherwise noted, page content is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) and code samples are licensed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

When you see a page with this notice you are free to use [nearly everything](#what-is-not-licensed) on the page in your own creations. For example, you could quote the text in a book, cut-and-paste sections to your blog, record it as an audiobook for the visually impaired, or even translate it into Swahili. Really. That's what open content licenses are all about. We just ask that you give us [attribution](#attribution) when you reuse our work.

If you have any questions about these terms of service, post to the [XMTP Q&A discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/xmtp/discussions/categories/q-a).

## What is _not_ licensed?

We say “nearly everything” as there are a few simple conditions that apply.

Trademarks and other brand features are not included in this license.

In some cases, a page might include content consisting of images, audio or video material, or a link to content on a different webpage (such as videos or slide decks). This content is not covered by the license, unless specifically noted.

## Attribution

Proper attribution is required when you reuse or create modified versions of content that appears on a page made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution license. The complete requirements for attribution can be found in section 3 of the [Creative Commons legal code](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).

In practice we ask that you provide attribution to XMTP to the best of the ability of the medium in which you are producing the work.

There are several typical ways in which this might apply:

#### Exact reproductions

If your online work _exactly reproduces_ text or images from this site, in whole or in part, please include a paragraph at the bottom of your page that reads:

>Portions of this page are reproduced from work created and [shared by XMTP](https://xmtp.org/terms) and used according to terms described in the [Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Also, please link back to the original source page so that readers can refer to it for more information.

#### Modified versions

If your online work shows _modified_ text or images based on the content from this site, please include a paragraph at the bottom of your page that reads:

>Portions of this page are modifications based on work created and [shared by XMTP](https://xmtp.org/terms) and used according to terms described in the [Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Again, please link back to the original source page so that readers can refer to it for more information. This is even more important when the content has been modified.

#### Other media

If you produce non-hypertext works, such as books, audio, or video, we ask that you make a best effort to include a spoken or written attribution in the spirit of the messages above.
