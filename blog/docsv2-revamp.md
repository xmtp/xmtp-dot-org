## **Core Concepts for Building with XMTP 🏗**

We’ve abstracted the core concepts to help you build with XMTP more swiftly. Think of it as a TV show guiding you on how to integrate secure and private chat into your application. These are the chapters you wouldn’t want to miss:

1. [Get started](https://xmtp.org/docs/build/get-started)
2. [Authenticate](https://xmtp.org/docs/build/authentication)
3. [Conversations](https://xmtp.org/docs/build/conversations)
4. [Messages](https://xmtp.org/docs/build/messages)

## **Left Nav Centralization 📘**

All documentation in a single Left Nav. It's like the chapters of a book, ensuring the lowest friction experience for learning software. This single tab approach ensures that you have a consistent navigation experience without the clutter.

On top of this all external sources where updated. Sources like Readme’s and independent pages that point only to the Docs, preventing outdated content from appearing again. This ensures everyone interacting with XMTP gets the latest and best experience, always.
