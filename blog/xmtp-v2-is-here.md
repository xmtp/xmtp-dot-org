Over the past 12 months, we’ve met with hundreds of development teams using the XMTP protocol to build native web3 messaging.

Whether it has been 2-person teams at a hackathon or the largest companies in web3, the feedback was unanimous: _deliver the highest standard in messaging security, while allowing me to build powerful end-user experiences in my app._

After 12 months of work, **we are excited to announce XMTP Protocol v2.**

“With XMTP v2, we’ve doubled down on our commitment to building the most secure, privacy-preserving communications protocol,” said Matt Galligan, CEO of XMTP Labs. “These enhancements deliver on XMTP’s promise of interoperability and help to ensure users fully own and control their communications.”.

But building an interoperable messaging network has its own set of challenges for app developers. Users like to be able to access messages from anywhere across the network, but want messaging experiences tailored to the app they are currently using.

## Improved developer transparency

Beyond the features that XMTP protocol v2 introduces, we have also improved the transparency of how the XMTP protocol, SDKs and applications work together.

### XMTP Protocol & Network Overview

We have published a [Protocol and Network Overview](https://github.com/xmtp/proto/blob/main/PROTOCOL.md) document on GitHub to help developers understand the core architecture of XMTP v2.

### Platform roadmap

We have published our [platform roadmap](/roadmap) to give developers more transparency on upcoming SDK support and features like push notifications and decentralization milestones.

### Deprecation date for pre-v7 versions of the SDK

Update your app to use >=v7.0.0 of the X[MTP client SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-js) by Jan 8, 2023 to start exploring the new XMTP v2 use cases for your app. v7.0.0 clients are fully compatible with pre-v7.0.0 clients. Conversations established using XMTP v1 can continue as before. However, conversations using XMTP v2 will not be visible to pre-v7.0.0 clients. To learn more, see [Determining whether to use XMTP v2 or v1 topics](/docs/concepts/architectural-overview#determining-whether-to-use-xmtp-v2-or-v1-topics).

To learn more about and discuss important deprecation details, see this [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/xmtp/discussions/17).

## Building web3 messaging together

XMTP v2 came together after thousands of interactions with developers. It is incredibly inspiring to meet so many developers who share our values and vision for web3. As we continue to work hand in hand, we’re looking forward to learning from you, testing ideas, and challenging ourselves.
