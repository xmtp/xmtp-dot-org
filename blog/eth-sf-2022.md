Altogether it was an incredible event. With 1,700 devs across 34 countries, [#ETHSanFrancisco](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ETHSanFrancisco?src=hashtag_click) was the largest IRL [@ETHGlobal](https://twitter.com/ETHGlobal) event yet!

Developers continued to amaze us, building apps on XMTP that went far beyond DMs, chat, and obvious messaging use cases.

Awesome work everyone!
