In this clip from an XMTP all-hands meeting, Shane takes us back to mid-2020 when we were gathering on Clubhouse as you could have the WILDEST conversations. Shinoda joined a room and talked about Facebook cutting him off from his audience, and how web3 could solve this for all artists in the future.
