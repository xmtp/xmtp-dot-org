It's been an amazing weekend in the city of New York! üóΩ Lots of people chose XMTP for building and sending secure messages, from Airtag trackers to DeFi notifications. We also had a great run on our newest version of the CryptoCornerStore.eth, in partnership with [**ENS**](https://ens.domains) and powered by [**Chainjet**](https://chainjet.io).

ü•à **Upper Social**: Upper is a social network with a twist; you can become a creator and sell your fragments to your fans and other creators. Fragment holders can trade creators' fragments and vote for proposals, allowing creators to borrow from the fragments pool and create more content.

_How it uses XMTP_: Once a fan acquire a Fragment it will give access to the Creator's chat. Chat is only accessible by holding Fragments.

ü§ñ **Scrubbie**: Scrubbie enhances messaging experiences by allowing XMTP clients to filter spam through a specialized API.

_How it uses XMTP_: We built an API to allow for all XMTP clients to have a simple way to filter for spam wallets. Clients do not have to trust our criteria, using our API that can set the criteria they care about the most to filter out spam wallets from messaging their users.
