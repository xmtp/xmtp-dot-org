## Set up a local environment

If you are contributing to xmtp.org, you might be interested in setting up a local environment where you can build the site.

xmtp.org is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static website generator.

### Prerequisites

Using Docusaurus requires that you have a [supported version of Node.js](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation) installed.

### Install Docusaurus

Run this command in the root folder of your fork of the `xmtp-dot-org` repo.

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Run a local development server

Run this command to start a local development server you can use to view the website.

```bash
$ npm run start
```

The command opens the website at `http://localhost:3000/` in your default browser.

As you make and save changes to markdown files, the website automatically updates to reflect most changes without having to restart the server.

### Generate and view a local static build

1. Run this command to generate static website content in the `build` directory.

   ```bash
   $ npm run build
   ```

2. Run this command to start a local server to view the static website content generated in the `build` directory.

   ```bash
   $ npm run serve
   ```

   The command opens the website at `http://localhost:3000/` in your default browser.

Note that any changes you save to markdown files aren't reflected in this static build because the command serves the website from the `build` directory, not the editable markdown files.
