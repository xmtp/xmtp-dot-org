# Content Types with XMTP

When you build an app with XMTP, all messages are encoded with a content type to ensure that an XMTP message API client knows how to encode and decode messages, ensuring interoperability and consistent display of messages across apps.

In addition, message payloads are transported as a set of bytes. This means that payloads can carry any content type that a client supports, such as plain text, JSON, or even non-text binary or media content.

At a high level, there are two categories of content types with XMTP:

- Standard
- Custom

## Standard content types

A standard content type is one that has undergone the XMTP Request for Comment (XRC) process and has been adopted as an XMTP Improvement Proposal (XIP).

To learn more about the XRC and XIP processes that enable a framework for community members to propose standards and achieve consensus about their adoption, see [XMTP Improvement Proposals (XIPs)](https://github.com/xmtp/XIPs#readme).

Once adopted, a standard content type is bundled in XMTP client SDKs. A developer can then import the standard content type from an SDK for use in their app.

- ### [Text Content Type](/docs/content-types/plain-text)

An app built with XMTP uses the `TextCodec` (plain text) standard content type by default. This means that if your app is sending plain text messages only, you don’t need to perform any additional steps related to content types.

- ### [Composite Content Type](/docs/content-types/composite)

If you want your app to be able to send multiple content types; such as any combination of plain text, images, audio, and video; in a single message, you must set up your app to use the `CompositeCodec` standard content type.

- ### [Attachment Content Type](/docs/content-types/attachment)

Attachments smaller than 1MB can be sent using the `AttachmentCodec`. The codec will automatically encrypt the attachment and upload it to the XMTP network.

- ### [Remote Attachment Content Type](/docs/content-types/remote-attachment)

Remote attachments of any size can be sent using the `RemoteAttachmentCodec` and a storage provider.

- ### [Read Receipt Content Type](/docs/content-types/read-receipt)

A read receipt is a `timestamp` that indicates when a message was read. It is sent as a message and can be used to calculate the time since the last message was read.

- ### [Reaction Content Type](/docs/content-types/reaction)

A reaction is a quick and often emoji-based way to respond to a message. Reactions are usually limited to a predefined set of emojis or symbols provided by the messaging app.

- ### [Reply Content Type](/docs/content-types/reply)

A reply is a method to directly respond to a specific message in a conversation. Users can select and reply to a particular message instead of sending a new one.

## Create Custom Content Types

:::caution
Your custom content type WILL NOT automatically be supported by other apps and will display fallback text in them instead.
:::

Keep in mind that any other application that intends to use your custom content type must implement it as per your definition.

- ### [Basic: Number multiplier Content Type](/docs/content-types/custom)

This tutorial will walk you through the process of building a custom content type dedicated to multiplying numbers. For demonstration purposes, we'll create a MultiplyCodec custom content type. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a robust and reusable piece of code ready to be incorporated into your XMTP project.

- ### [Advanced: Sending a polygon transaction](/docs/content-types/custom)

This tutorial will walk you through the process of building a custom content type dedicated to send transaction hashes on the polygon blockchain.

## Not supported content types

While showing messages in your app you should be aware that some content types are not supported by all XMTP clients. If you want to display a message with a content type that is not supported by your app, you can use a set of if statements to be sure you are supporting your desire conrtent types but also rendering with a fallback the ones not supported.

<Tabs groupId="sdk-langs">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript"  attributes={{className: "js_tab"}}>

```jsx
/*
 ** For loop iterating through messages
 */

// Checking the type of the content in the message
if (message.contentType.sameAs(ContentTypeRemoteAttachment)) {
  // If the content is a remote attachment, return a RemoteURL component
  // Add a key prop to force a re-render when a new message is sent
  return <RemoteURL key={message.id} attachment={message.content} />;
} else if (message.contentType.sameAs(ContentTypeAttachment)) {
  // If the content is an attachment, get its URL
  // It handles local attachments stored within the application server
  return objectURL(message.content);
} else if (message.contentType.sameAs(ContentTypeReadReceipt)) {
  // If the content is a read receipt, update the read receipts for this message
  updateReadReceipts(message, messages);
} else if (message.contentType.sameAs(ContentTypeReply)) {
  // If the content is a reply, render the reply
  // This handles how reply messages are displayed
  return renderReply(message.content);
} else if (message.contentType.sameAs(ContentTypeReaction)) {
  // If the content is a reaction (like a like, love, etc.), return the reaction
  // This handles how reactions are displayed
  return reaction(message.content);
} else {
  // If the content is a simple text message, display it in a span element
  return <span>{message.content}</span>;
}else {
  // If the content is a simple text message or an unhandled type, display it in a span element
  return <span>{"Fallback message"}</span>;
}

/*
 ** End of loop
