# XMTP Improvement Proposals

An XMTP Improvement Proposal (XIP) is a design document providing information to the XMTP community, or describing a new feature for XMTP or its processes or environment. The XIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The XIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

We intend XIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community technical input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into XMTP.

To learn more about XIPs and how to participate in the process, including authoring an XIP of your own, see [XIP purpose, process, and guidelines](https://github.com/xmtp/XIPs/blob/main/XIPs/xip-0-purpose-process.md).
