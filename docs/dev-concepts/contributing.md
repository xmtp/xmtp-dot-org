## ‚ùî Questions

Have questions? Get help from the [XMTP Discord community](https://discord.gg/xmtp).

## üêû Bugs

Report a bug by creating an issue in the [related XMTP GitHub repo](https://github.com/xmtp/). Please confirm that there isn't an existing open issue about the bug and include detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

## ‚ú® Feature requests

Request features by creating an issue in the [related XMTP GitHub repo](https://github.com/xmtp/). Please confirm there isn't an existing open issue requesting the feature. Let us know which use cases the feature can unlock so that we can investigate and prioritize.

## üîÄ Pull requests

We encourage pull requests (PRs) from the community, but we suggest that you start with a feature request or a post to [XMTP GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/xmtp/discussions), just to do a temperature check. For example, if the PR involves a major change to the XMTP protocol, it must be fleshed out as an [XMTP Improvement Proposal](https://github.com/xmtp/XIPs/blob/main/XIPs/xip-0-purpose-process.md) before work begins.
