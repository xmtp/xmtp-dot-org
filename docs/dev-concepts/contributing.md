## 🔀 Pull requests

We encourage pull requests (PRs) from the community, but we suggest that you start with a feature request or a post to the [XMTP Community Forum on Discourse](https://community.xmtp.org/), just to do a temperature check. For example, if the PR involves a major change to the XMTP protocol, it must be fleshed out as an [XMTP Improvement Proposal](https://github.com/xmtp/XIPs/blob/main/XIPs/xip-0-purpose-process.md) before work begins.
