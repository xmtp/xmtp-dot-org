# ðŸ“§ What is XMTP?

**XMTP is a web3 communication network, enabling messaging between wallets.**

In Q1 2022, we will publicly release a JavaScript SDK that implements the client layer of our protocol. Applications using this SDK will interface with an XMTP-operated testnet that will manage message relay and storage. Prior to this release, XMTP will privately distribute a pre-stable, draft SDK to select partners and community members for evaluation and feedback.

You can join that list of pre-stable testers [**by filling out this form**](https://xmtp.typeform.com/join-waitlist).
