# ðŸ›  SDK

The XMTP SDK bundles code libraries, components, tools, documentation, and guides that developers may use to build client experiences on top of the XMTP protocol and network. Component packages may be installed via `npm` or downloaded directly from public GitHub repositories.

Initially, the SDK will include:

- `xmtp-js`: An `npm` package that Javascript applications can use to interact with the XMTP protocol and network.
- `xmtp-react-chat-example`: A React example app that developers may customize and deploy to the target environment of their choosing.

The future roadmap for the SDK includes additional language support (e.g. Swift) and a React UI kit.

:::danger Please Note

The XMTP protocol is in the early stages of development. The SDK is being provided for evaluation, feedback, and community contribution. It has not undergone a formal security audit and is not intended for production applications.
