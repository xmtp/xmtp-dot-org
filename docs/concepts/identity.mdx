# Identity with XMTP

<strong><em>Connect your digital identity to XMTP to provide users with secure, censorship-resistant messaging.</em></strong>

XMTP makes it simple to take any digital identity and use it as the basis for private, end-to-end encrypted, quantum-resistant conversations in your app.

<br/>

## Supported identities

XMTP is **open by design**. A single XMTP inbox can be associated with multiple identifiers, each cryptographically verified:

- **Wallets** → EVM addresses, smart contract wallets, ERC-4337 accounts
- **Passkeys** → device-native WebAuthn credentials (p256)
- **World ID** → proof of personhood
- **Social IDs** → ENS, Farcaster, Lens, Base handles
- **Future networks** → Bluesky, Nostr, BTC, Solana, or any identity you want to support

With XMTP, you don't need to build a secure messaging layer for your app. Just connect your identity system to XMTP, and provide your users with encrypted, censorship-resistant communication out of the box.

## How identity works with XMTP

On XMTP, every user has an **inbox**, identified by a cryptographic **InboxID**.

That inbox can be linked to one or more identifiers through signed **IdentityActions**, defined in [XIP-46](https://community.xmtp.org/t/xip-46-multi-wallet-identity/639?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Below are the core technical concepts for creating, managing, recovering, and verifying identity with XMTP. 

### Manage identities with XMTP

Your app has complete control over how users' identities are connected to messaging. With XMTP, you can:

- **Create** → spin up a new inbox tied to a user's chosen identity
- **Link** → add additional identifiers (wallets, passkeys, social IDs) to the same inbox
- **Recover** → restore access if one identifier is lost or compromised
- **Rotate** → change or update the recovery authority that safeguards the inbox

### Secure recovery for compromised inboxes

Each inbox has a **recovery authority** (e.g., a wallet or passkey) that can revoke associations or rotate control if another identifier is compromised.

- A designated identifier (e.g., wallet or passkey) with the ability to revoke associations or transfer recovery rights.
- Provides resilience if a linked identifier is lost or compromised.
- Prevents single-point lockouts.

### Identity verification

- All associations are backed by cryptographic signatures.
- The XMTP SDKs verify proofs so apps don't have to implement their own crypto.
- Ensures identifiers cannot be spoofed or maliciously linked.

## XMTP identity roadmap

- **Late 2025** → Decentralized identity coordination on the XMTP Appchain as part of mainnet launch.
- **2026** → Add more networks and identities like Solana, Bitcoin, and Bluesky.

## Why XMTP

XMTP's mission is to increase the world's freedom to communicate. 

By connecting your identity model to XMTP, you give your users a messaging experience that is:

- **Secure by default** → End-to-end encryption with MLS, forward secrecy, post-compromise security, and post-quantum protection.
- **Private** → Metadata protection ensures no one can see who is messaging whom, when, or how often.
- **Resilient** → Recovery authority prevents lockout and allows compromised identifiers to be revoked.
- **Composable** → Users can unify multiple identifiers (wallets, passkeys, social IDs) into a single inbox.
- **Standards-based** → Built on open cryptographic standards and XIPs like [XIP-46](https://community.xmtp.org/t/xip-46-multi-wallet-identity/639?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
