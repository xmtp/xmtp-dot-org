## XMTP Improvement Proposals

XMTP Improvement Proposals (XIPs) propose and document updates to XMTP, which may become standards for XMTP clients and applications to adopt.

Is there something your app needs that the protocol doesn’t currently support? Consider creating an [XMTP Improvement Proposal](https://github.com/xmtp/XIPs/blob/ae6fc638332f57f918d82a096f69b1e79df0bd0a/XIPs/xip-0-purpose-process.md) (XIP).

Here’s a [template](https://github.com/xmtp/XIPs/blob/main/xip-template.md) you can use to create one.

Take a look at [existing XIPs](https://github.com/xmtp/XIPs/tree/main/XIPs). XIPs are meant to reflect the needs of the XMTP developer community and benefit from your input and expertise.
