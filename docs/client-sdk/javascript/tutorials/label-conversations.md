# Use labels to differentiate multiple conversations between a pair of addresses

With XMTP, a pair of blockchain account addresses can have multiple ongoing conversations. In addition, with XMTP, an app can display all conversations a user has, regardless of the app they used to create the conversation. This concept is known as a portable, or universal, inbox.

Alternatively, an app can implement conversation IDs and metadata to [filter conversations](filter-conversations). For example, a developer can choose to assign app-specific conversation IDs and metadata to filter and display only conversations created by their app.

Apps that assign conversation IDs in this way have an effect on apps that use a portable inbox model. For example, a user might see multiple separate and ongoing conversations they are having with the same address, but originating in different apps.

If you're using a portable inbox model for your app, you can display conversation labels based on conversation IDs and metadata to help clarify the user experience.

To illustrate this scenario, let's take a look at a couple of conversations between `amal.eth` and `bola.eth`.

`amal.eth` and `bola.eth` can have an ongoing conversation in App ABC. Let's say that App ABC sets a `conversationId` of `app.abc/dm` and uses it to filter conversations to display only conversations its users created using App ABC.

![Mockup of App ABC setting a conversation ID of app.abc/dm and filtering conversations by it. The app displays amal.eth's inbox with a "Hey..." conversation from bola.eth](img/app-abc.png)

`amal.eth` and `bola.eth` can also have a separate and ongoing conversation in App XYZ. Let's say that App XYZ sets a `conversationId` of `app.xyz/dm` and uses it to filter conversations to display only conversations its users created using App XYZ.

![Mockup of App XYZ setting a conversation ID of app.xyz/dm and filtering conversations by it. The app displays amal.eth's inbox with a "Yes..." conversation from bola.eth](img/app-xyz.png)

Let's then take a look at App 123, which doesn't filter conversations and displays all conversations for a user regardless of where the conversations were created. In this case, the inbox for `amal.eth` might look something like this:

![Mockup of App 123 with no conversation ID or filtering. The app displays amal.eth's inbox with two conversations with bola.eth: One "Hey..." and one "Yes..."](img/app-123.png)

This scenario may display a confusing user experience for `amal.eth`, surfacing two separate conversations they are having with the same address, `bola.eth`.

To help distinguish the multiple conversations `amal.eth` is having with the same address, you can implement labels, based on conversation IDs and metadata, that display for each conversation.

![Mockup of App 123 with no conversation ID or filtering, but with conversation ID and metadata-based labels implemented. The app displays amal.eth's inbox with two conversations with bola.eth: One labeled as app.abc: "Hey..." and one labeled as app.xyz: "Yes..."](img/app-123-convo-labels.png)

These labels can help `amal.eth` recognize the source of each conversation with `bola.eth` and understand why multiple conversations are displaying.

**To use labels to differentiate multiple conversations between a pair of addresses:**

Get the `conversationId` value to display as a label.

For example:

```js
// To get the conversationId
const conversationId = conversation?.context?.conversationId

// Example conversationId = app.abc/dm/0x123-0x456

const domain = conversationId.split("/")[0]

// In this case, the domain is app.abc, which provides the conversation label
```
