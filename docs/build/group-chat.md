# Build group chat with XMTP

:::info JavaScript

At present, the JavaScript SDK lacks support for Group Chat functionalities. Nevertheless, for those looking to integrate backend features, the CLI provides a viable solution, as detailed in [this repository](https://github.com/xmtp/libxmtp/tree/main/examples/cli). For practical application, an example implementation is available on [Replit](https://replit.com/@neekolas/Groups-Nodejs-Client#src/index.ts). To explore group functionalities further, refer to the comprehensive [Token Gated Group Chat Tutorial](/docs/tutorials/token-gated-group-chat).

Secure group chats are an important part of every messaging app. In this guide, we delve into the essentials of using XMTP for creating secure group chats. From the initial steps of starting a new group chat, listing and caching conversations for quick access, to advanced topics like managing group members and synchronizing message history data across devices.

## Create a group chat

Initiate a new group chat with a list of specified addresses. To create a group, the recipient must have already started their client at least once on the XMTP network.

<Tabs groupId="groupchats">
<TabItem value="rn" label="React Native" attributes={{className: "rn_tab "}}>

```jsx
const group = await client.conversations.newGroup(
  [walletAddress1, walletAddress2],
  // Set permissions for the group. Options include "creator_admin" where only the creator has admin rights, or "everyone_admin" where all members are admins.
  { permissions: "creator_admin" },
);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin" attributes={{className: "kotlin_tab"}}>

```kotlin
val group = client.conversations.newGroup(listOf(walletAddress1, walletAddress2),
  // Set permissions for the group. Options include "creator_admin" where only the creator has admin rights, or "everyone_admin" where all members are admins.
  permissions = "creator_admin"
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="swift" label="Swift"  attributes={{className: "swift_tab"}}>

```swift
let group = try await client.conversations.newGroup(with: [walletAddress1, walletAddress2],
// Set permissions for the group. Options include "creator_admin" where only the creator has admin rights, or "everyone_admin" where all members are admins.
permissions: "creator_admin")
```

## List group chat conversations

Retrieve all existing group chat conversations associated with the current XMTP client. Refer to the [Conversations](/docs/build/conversations.md) section for more details.

<Tabs groupId="groupchats">
<TabItem value="rn" label="React Native" attributes={{className: "rn_tab "}}>

```jsx
//First fetch new data from the network
await client.conversations.syncGroups();
//Get the updated group list
const groups = await client.conversations.listGroups();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin" attributes={{className: "kotlin_tab"}}>

```kotlin
//First fetch new data from the network
client.conversations.syncGroups()
//Get the updated group list
val groups = client.conversations.listGroups()
```

List all conversations for both group and individual conversations.

```kotlin
// List all conversations, including both group and individual
val conversations = client.conversations.list(includeGroups = true)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="swift" label="Swift"  attributes={{className: "swift_tab"}}>

## Check if a group chat is active

The `isActive` property indicates whether the current user is still a participant in the group chat. If the group chat is not active for the user, it typically means the user has been removed from the group. Developers should use this status to adjust the user interface accordingly. If a group chat is not active for a user, the application should hide or disable functionalities such as sending messages and adding or removing members. This ensures a good user experience and prevents actions that are not permissible due to the user's status in the group chat.

<Tabs groupId="groupchats">
<TabItem value="rn" label="React Native" attributes={{className: "rn_tab "}}>

```jsx
const isActive = await group.isActive();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin" attributes={{className: "kotlin_tab"}}>

## Messages

To ensure your application has the latest group chat details, including the member list and most recent messages, it's crucial to periodically synchronize each group chat. This can be particularly important after joining a group, adding new members, or sending messages.

### Check if a user can message a group

Determine if a user has permission to message a specific group.

<Tabs groupId="groupchats">
<TabItem value="rn" label="React Native" attributes={{className: "rn_tab "}}>

```jsx
const canMessage = await group.canGroupMessage([
  caro.address,
  alix.address,
  "0xNewAddress",
]);
```

:::caution Group chats are per installation
Group chats in XMTP are tied to each installation. This means that while you can access your group chats on multiple devices, the message history is specific to the device where the chat was started. Therefore, when you log in on a new device, you'll see ongoing conversations but only new messages will appear. We are working to improve this feature for better cross-device synchronization.
:::

## Manage group chat members

You can list, add, and remove members from a group chat. Only the group chat creator has permission to add or remove members. This restriction ensures that only authorized individuals can modify the participant list.

<Tabs groupId="groupchats">
<TabItem value="rn" label="React Native" attributes={{className: "rn_tab "}}>

Retrieve a list of wallet addresses for all members in the group chat

```jsx
const members = await group.memberAddresses();
```

Add new members to an existing group chat using their wallet addresses.

```jsx
await group.addMembers([walletAddress]);
```

Determine which wallet address added the current user to a group.

```tsx
const addedByAddress = await group.addedByAddress();
```

Check if the address is an admin

```tsx
const isAdmin = await group.isAdmin();
```

Remove members from an existing group chat using their wallet addresses.

<Tabs groupId="groupchats">
<TabItem value="rn" label="React Native" attributes={{className: "rn_tab "}}>

To get the current name of a group chat:

```jsx
const groupName = await group.groupName();
```

To update the name of a group chat:

```jsx
await group.updateGroupName("New Group Name");
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin" attributes={{className: "kotlin_tab"}}>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

_Remember to do `await group.sync()` to synchronize the group's data, including the name_

## Listen for new messages and updates

Streams enable real-time monitoring of new messages in a group chat and member management activities like adding and removing members. Here's how you can set up a stream for message updates. Refer to this [section](/docs/build/streams.md) for more details on streams.

<Tabs groupId="groupchats">
<TabItem value="rn" label="React Native" attributes={{className: "rn_tab "}}>

List for messages specific to a group chat

```jsx
// Assuming `group` is an existing group chat object
const streamGroupMessages = async (group) => {
  const cancelGroupMessageStream = await group.streamGroupMessages(
    async (message) => {
      console.log(`New message: ${message.content}`);
      // Membership updates
      if (message.contentTypeId === ContentTypes.GroupMembershipChange) {
        const addresses = await group.memberAddresses();
        // Get new members
        console.log(addresses); // Example usage of addresses
      }
    },
  );

  // Use cancelGroupMessageStream() to stop listening to group updates
  return cancelGroupMessageStream;
};
```

And for streaming all conversations, including individual and groups:

```jsx
const streamAllGroupMessages = async (client) => {
  const allConvos = [];
  const cancelStreamAllGroupMessages =
    await client.conversations.streamAllGroupMessages(async (message) => {
      console.log(`New message: ${message.content}`);
    });
  // Use cancelStreamAllGroupMessages() to stop listening to all conversation updates
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin" attributes={{className: "kotlin_tab"}}>

```kotlin
// Stream new messages in a group chat
val group = client.conversations.newGroup(listOf(walletAddress1, walletAddress2))
val messageStream = group.streamMessages()

// Collect from the Flow to receive messages
messageStream.collect { message ->
    print("New message from ${message.senderAddress}: ${message.body}")
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="swift" label="Swift"  attributes={{className: "swift_tab"}}>

```swift
// Assuming `group` is an existing group chat object
for try await message in group.streamMessages() {
    print("New message: \(message.content)")
}

## Listen for new group chats

Monitor the creation of new group chats.

<Tabs groupId="groupchats">
<TabItem value="rn" label="React Native" attributes={{className: "rn_tab "}}>

```jsx
// Listen for group chat updates
const streamGroups = async (client) => {
  const groups = [];
  const cancelStreamGroups = await client.conversations.streamGroups(
    (group) => {
      groups.push(group);
    },
  );

  // Use cancelStreamGroups() to stop listening to group updates
};
```

And for streaming all conversations, including individual and groups:

```jsx
const streamAllConversations = async (client) => {
  const allConvos = [];
  const cancelStreamAll = await client.conversations.streamAll(
    (conversation) => {
      allConvos.push(conversation);
    },
  );

  // Use cancelStreamAll() to stop listening to all conversation updates
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin" attributes={{className: "kotlin_tab"}}>

```kotlin
// Stream updates for all group conversations
val groupsStream = client.conversations.streamGroups()

groupsStream.collect { group ->
    println("New or updated group: ${group.id}")
}
```

Keep your conversation list current by streaming updates for both group and individual conversations.

```kotlin
// Stream updates for all conversations, including individual and groups
val conversationsAndGroupsStream = client.conversations.streamAll()

allConversationsStream.collect { grouporconv ->
    println("New or updated group or conversation: ${grouporconv.id}")
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="swift" label="Swift"  attributes={{className: "swift_tab"}}>

```swift
// Stream updates for all group conversations
for try await group in client.conversations.streamGroups() {
    print("New or updated group: \(group.id)")
}
```

And for streaming all conversations, including individual and groups:

```swift
// Stream updates for all conversations, including individual and groups
for try await conversation in client.conversations.streamAll() {
    print("New or updated conversation: \(conversation.id)")
}
```

## Manage group member consent

With XMTP, in addition to adding and removing members from a group chat, you can also manage permissions that control who is allowed or denied access to the group. Consent is crucial for maintaining control over group interactions and ensuring that only authorized members can participate. To learn more, see [Allow/block](/docs/build/user-consent).

### Allow and deny access to a group

You can explicitly allow or deny access to a group chat. This is particularly useful in scenarios where group membership needs to be tightly controlled.

<Tabs groupId="groupchats">
<TabItem value="rn" label="React Native" attributes={{className: "rn_tab "}}>

```jsx
// Allow a member to access a group
await group.allowMembers([walletAddress]);

// Deny a member's access to a group
await group.denyMembers([walletAddress]);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin" attributes={{className: "kotlin_tab"}}>

### Check if a group is allowed or denied

You can check if a group is allowed or denied for a member. This method helps manage user experiences and access based on their group status.

<Tabs groupId="groupchats">
<TabItem value="rn" label="React Native" attributes={{className: "rn_tab "}}>

```jsx
// Check if a group is allowed for a member
const isAllowed = await group.isGroupAllowed(walletAddress);

// Check if a group is denied for a member
const isDenied = await group.isGroupDenied(walletAddress);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin" attributes={{className: "kotlin_tab"}}>

## Synchronize group chats

XMTP's sync methods bring current data from the network and update the local database.

- **After signing in**: Immediately update group conversation data.
- **Periodically**: Keep data current based on your app's requirements.
- **After receiving a notification**: Reflect changes in group membership prompted by notifications.

### syncGroups()

This method is used to sync all groups in the conversations array.

<Tabs groupId="groupchats">
<TabItem value="rn" label="React Native" attributes={{className: "rn_tab "}}>

```jsx
// List groups without syncing with the network
let groups = await client.conversations.listGroups(true);
// groups length might be 0 if not synced after group creation
// Sync groups and list again
await client.conversations.syncGroups();
groups = await client.conversations.listGroups(true);
console.log(groups.length); // groups length reflects the actual number of groups
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin" attributes={{className: "kotlin_tab"}}>

```kotlin
client.conversations.syncGroups()
```

List all conversations for both group and individual conversations.

```kotlin
// List all conversations, including both group and individual
val conversations = client.conversations.list(includeGroups = true)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="swift" label="Swift"  attributes={{className: "swift_tab"}}>

```swift
try await client.conversations.sync()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dart" label="Dart"  attributes={{className: "dart_tab"}}>

The [Flutter SDK](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-flutter) is being deprecated. For information about alternative solutions or how to contribute to maintaining this SDK, please join the XMTP Discord.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### sync()

This method is used to synchronize specific data for a single group, such as new messages and membership changes. It ensures that the group's data is up to date with the latest changes from the network.

<Tabs groupId="groupchats">
<TabItem value="rn" label="React Native" attributes={{className: "rn_tab "}}>

```jsx
// Assume group is an existing group chat object
await group.sync(); // Synchronizes the group's messages and members
// Fetch messages without network sync
const messages = await group.messages(true);
console.log(messages.length); // Shows messages fetched from local data
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Note on conversations and messages in group chats

It's important to note that all the features and methods described in [Conversations](/docs/build/conversations) and [Messages](/docs/build/messages) are fully applicable to group chats as well. This includes starting new conversations, checking if an address is on the network, sending messages, and listing existing conversations. XMTP's API design ensures that you can manage group chats with the same ease and flexibility as one-on-one conversations.
