## 🧑‍💻 Contribute to open source projects

You can contribute to any public repo in the [XMTP GitHub org](https://github.com/xmtp) or [EphemeraHQ GitHub org](https://github.com/ephemeraHQ).

- **🐛 Report bugs**: Create an issue with detailed steps in the relevant repo. Please check first to avoid duplicates.

- **🌟 Request features**: Create an issue describing your use case and how the feature could help. The more detail, the better!

- **📦 Submit pull requests**:  
  Thinking about opening a PR? Start with a feature request or post in the [Community Forum](https://community.xmtp.org/) to get feedback first.

  If your PR makes major protocol changes, it should first be written up as an [XMTP Improvement Proposal](https://github.com/xmtp/XIPs/blob/main/XIPs/xip-0-purpose-process.md) (XIP).

  If your PR is merged, you're eligible for an [XMTP contributor POAP](https://www.gitpoap.io/s/xmtp)!

## 📜 XMTP Improvement Proposals (XIPs)

XIPs are formal proposals to improve XMTP. They help evolve the protocol in the open with input from the community.

Is there something your app needs that XMTP doesn’t yet support? Propose a change by creating an XIP.

- Use the [XIP template](https://github.com/xmtp/XIPs/blob/main/xip-template.md) to get started.
- Review [existing XIPs](https://github.com/xmtp/XIPs/tree/main/XIPs) for ideas and prior proposals.

You don’t need to be a protocol engineer to contribute to XIPs. If you have insight into what should change or how something can be improved, we want your voice in the process.
