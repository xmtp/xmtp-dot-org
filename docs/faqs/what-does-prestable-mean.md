# What does "pre-stable" mean?

The XMTP protocol is in the early stages of development. This initial SDK is being provided for evaluation, feedback, and community contribution, and is not intended for production applications. Breaking changes should be anticipated until the "pre-stable" label is dropped. Additionally, messages sent with the pre-stable SDK should not contain sensitive information or for purposes requiring guaranteed or timely delivery.
